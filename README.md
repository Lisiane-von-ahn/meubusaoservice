# MeuBusaoService

Welcome to MeuBusaoService! This is a Flask-based bus transportation API that retrieves data from a PostgreSQL database in a cloud structure.

## Installation

To install MeuBusaoService, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Lisiane-von-ahn/meubusaoservice.git

# Navigate into the project directory
cd meubusaoservice

# Install dependencies using pip
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up your PostgreSQL database and configure the connection details in the `config.py` file.

# Run the Flask application
python app.py

# Real-time bus tracking
üìç Interactive route maps
üó∫Ô∏è Personalized journey planner
üöÄ
Certainly! Here's a section you can include in your README.md file to explain what GTFS is:

## What is GTFS?

GTFS, which stands for General Transit Feed Specification, is a data specification that defines a common format for public transportation schedules and associated geographic information. Developed by Google in 2005, GTFS enables public transit agencies to publish their transit data in a standardized format that can be easily consumed by developers, transit planners, and the public.

### Key Components of GTFS:

1. **Feed**: A collection of files containing transit data, typically provided by a transit agency.
  
2. **Stops**: Points where vehicles stop along a transit route, identified by their geographic coordinates and unique identifiers.

3. **Routes**: Lines or paths that vehicles follow, connecting stops and forming transit services.

4. **Trips**: Instances of vehicles traveling along specific routes at specific times.

5. **Schedules**: Timing information for trips, specifying arrival and departure times at each stop.

6. **Calendar Dates**: Dates when specific transit services are active or inactive, allowing for variations in schedules over time.

7. **Frequencies**: Information about regularly occurring service intervals, useful for services with consistent headways rather than fixed schedules.

### Purpose and Benefits:

- **Interoperability**: GTFS provides a standardized format for transit data, enabling interoperability between different transit systems and applications.

- **Accessibility**: By making transit data readily available in a standardized format, GTFS promotes the development of applications and services that help users navigate public transportation networks more effectively.

- **Innovation**: GTFS data fuels the development of innovative transit-related tools and services, ranging from journey planners and route optimization algorithms to real-time transit tracking applications.

- **Transparency**: Publicly available GTFS data promotes transparency and accountability within transit agencies by allowing the public to easily access and analyze information about transit services and schedules.

### Usage:

Developers can use GTFS data to create a wide range of applications and services, including journey planners, mobile transit apps, route optimization tools, and data visualizations. Additionally, transit agencies can leverage GTFS to share their transit data with the public, researchers, and other stakeholders, fostering collaboration and innovation in the transit industry.
